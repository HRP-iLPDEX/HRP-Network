Sends a message across the channel

Submission is a privileged action involving two parties: The operator and the origin.
Apps (aka operators) need to be authorized by the `origin` to submit messages via this channel.

Furthermore, this channel restricts the origin to a single account, that of the principal.
In essence this ensures that only the principal account can send messages via this channel.

For pre-production testing, the restriction to the principal account can be bypassed by using
`setPrincipal` to set the principal to the address 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000042.
